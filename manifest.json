    "long_description": "Anonymous Q and A Bot enables teams to ask questions and receive anonymous responses with a built-in voting system. Users can post questions to any channel, and team members can respond anonymously through a simple button click. All responses appear in threads with upvote/downvote reactions, and the app automatically tracks and displays point totals. Question posters can close voting to announce the winning response. Perfect for:\n\n• Gathering honest feedback without attribution\n• Team surveys and polls\n• Anonymous Q&A sessions\n• Decision-making with community input\n• Retrospectives and team discussions\n\nAll responses are completely anonymous - the original responder is never identified. The app supports multiple workspaces and stores all data securely in an encrypted database."
