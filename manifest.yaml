  long_description: "Anonymous Q and A Bot enables teams to ask questions and receive anonymous responses with a built-in voting system. Users can post questions to any channel, and team members can respond anonymously through a simple button click. All responses appear in threads with upvote/downvote reactions, and the app automatically tracks and displays point totals. Question posters can close voting to announce the winning response. Perfect for gathering honest feedback, team surveys, anonymous Q&A sessions, decision-making with community input, and retrospectives."
